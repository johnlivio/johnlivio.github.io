The opportunity to develop the Shipping Calculator arose after the Logistics team negotiated more competitive shipping rates. Our goal was twofold: improve user experience (UX) by moving information to the beginning of the journey and capitalize on the new shipping value as a sales differentiator. The result was a direct increase in retention and conversion of our e-commerce.',

Unexpected costs and delivery times were the main friction point, generating frustration and high drop-off (abandonment) rates. The timing for change was driven by the commercial area: after negotiating lower shipping rates, the demand became to display this new competitive value as early as possible. The UX problem therefore became a strategic opportunity to drive sales.',

        benchmarking_text: 'The exploration phase focused on predictability and agility. We analyzed market patterns (benchmarking) from major players like Amazon and Mercado Livre. The clear pattern was displaying a ZIP Code field in the product detail to provide immediate feedback. From this, we defined: the field should be right below the price (high attention area), be easy to interact with, and offer results in a concise and integrated way to the page, without modals or redirects.',
        design_implementation_title: 'Design and Implementation: Transparency and Agility',
        design_implementation_text: 'The final solution focused on fluid experience. We implemented a ZIP Code mask (00000-000) to minimize typing errors and ensure quick interaction. The return text (delivery time and value) was integrated consistently with the app\'s Design System, ensuring users view the information without leaving the page. The main field was named in a friendly way: \'Choose your location / Update ZIP Code\'.',

        impact_text: 'The project was a success in aligning UX and business, delivering measurable value: For Business (KPIs): Average increase of 2.5% in checkout conversion rate. Direct support to commercial objectives, using shipping information (now more competitive) as a conversion lever. For User (UX): 100% clarity and predictability in total purchase cost. Greater brand confidence and a simplified, surprise-free shopping journey.',
        key_takeaways_shipping: 'The main lesson from this project is that transparency is a powerful conversion tool. By moving critical information to the right moment in the journey (and capitalizing on logistics negotiation with more attractive shipping rates), we transformed a friction point into a competitive advantage.

Users frequently reported difficulties in: Locating important items (e.g., Favorites, Followed Stores). Updating personal information. Viewing their order status and credit limit.

Qualitative Research: We selected a specific group of users and conducted in-depth research to understand their main pain points, needs, and expectations regarding the screen. Usage Assessment and Prioritization: Functional Analysis: We mapped all functionalities and shortcuts present in the original profile screen, identifying those with low usage or poor positioning. Prioritization: Based on usage data and research, we defined essential functionalities (e.g., Credit Limit, Orders, Personal Data) and prioritized them in the new layout, deprioritizing or reorganizing lower-value elements.',
        solution_title: 'Solution',
        solution_text: 'The solution process was incremental and based on rigorous testing to ensure the choice of the most effective design. A/B Testing and Design Iteration: Option Development: We created different layout prototypes for the new profile screen, focusing on clearer navigation and optimized visual hierarchy. A/B Tests: We conducted A/B tests with a user sample to evaluate which design performed best in terms of clarity, ease of item location, and engagement with key resources. Post-Test Refinement: The A/B test winning design was nearly finalized, but user feedback indicated the lack of an explanatory subtitle in certain sections. We added this subtitle in the final version to improve clarity and reduce ambiguity, ensuring a more complete experience.',

Metric Impact: Credit Requests: More than 50% increase in credit requests. Engagement with Key Resources: Greater ease of access to "Favorites," "Orders," and "Credit Limit" (impact inferred by usability improvement). Clarity and Satisfaction: Expected reduction in negative feedback related to navigation and information location in the profile. The more than 50% increase in credit requests demonstrates that optimizing profile screen usability unlocked an important revenue and value source for the business by facilitating access to an important financial resource.',
